    # So when ruby reaches line 93 and this hire_chef method is executed
    self
    # is the a_mineira instance. So we could do
    # self.print_customers, or self.stars, or self.chef

    # Thing is, as this is an instance method, and we have access to the instance
    # variables, why would we use self? Basically, you're gonna use it when you
    # need to reference the instance on which the method was called.
    # A good example is:
    @chef = Chef.new(chef_name, self)
